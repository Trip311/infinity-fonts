Another uniqueness lies in the construction, because it is essentially a sans-serif typeface that has only occasional indication of serifs – either via the “hidden” serifs caused by stroke tapering or by slightly thickening the stroke endings.\n\nAboreto comes in one weight - a high contrast regular that is on the thinner side.To contribute, see github.com/domija/Aboreto.",

This upgrade gives additional weight styles and expands the glyphset to support full Latin and Cyrillic characters sets. Rendering is also much improved.\n\nRead more at software.sil.org/andika\nTo contribute, see github.com/silnrsi/font-andika.",

Unusually this type includes lowercase letters. The high x-height gives the text a compact look, true to the original Cooperplate Gothic design. The general form is less condensed. It has diagonal stress, and a soft variation in contrast to improve legibility. It is bolder than normal for better rasterization on screen. The typeface works smoothly at text sizes with its delicate serifs, which gives a crisp effect on the screen. At larger sizes it shows a strong personality with the combination of serif details and the modulation of its strokes. It is useful for both short text and headlines, but it is also comfortable for reading on screen.Designed by Dario Muhafara for tipo foundry.",

    "description": "Baskervville is a revival of Jacob’s revival of Baskerville’s typeface. It was distributed by the Berger-Levrault Foundry from 1815. The font Jacob produced was sold as a “Caractères dans le genre Baskerwille” i.e. “Baskerwille alike fonts” — with a w instead of a v. The particularity of Jacob’s Baskerwille is that the roman is very close to Baskerville’s typefaces while the italic is closer to Didot’s typefaces. The ANRT workshop that took place for five days aimed to digitize Jacob’s font in order to show his work which moves from transitional to modern styles. The typeface was then developed and engineered by Rosalie Wagner.\n\nBaskervville was designed by the ANRT students from 2017 (Alexis Faudot, Rémi Forte, Morgane Pierson, Rafael Ribas, Tanguy Vanlaeys and Rosalie Wagner), under the direction of Charles Mazé and Thomas Huot-Marchand. \n\nIn 2025, a bold weight designed by Thomas Huot-Marchand was added. Rosalie Wagner fixed some kerning and glyphset issues and improved the font's outlines for a better rendering on screen.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/anrt-type/ANRT-Baskervville\n\nIn 1779, Sarah Eaves manages to sell Baskerville’s punches and supplies to Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais. Beaumarchais places his new printing house —Société Littéraire Typographique— in Kehl, Germany (6 kilometers away from Strasbourg, France) and gives Jean François Letellier the post of director. Letellier is in charge of supervising the negotiations of the sale and the transfer of the material from Birmingham to Kehl. Given the complexity of this work, Letellier hires a former Baskerville employee, presumably John Handy who had worked with Baskerville for a long time, “to check, inspect, and put right if necessary all the punches used by Baskerville”. But this employee being too old to leave England, Letellier decides to send an employee of Société Littéraire Typographique, named Claude Jacob, to Birmingham to carry out this work.\n\n1784. Soon after his return from Birmingham, Jacob has an argument with his employer (probably Letellier) and leaves Kehl with another employee of the Société Littéraire Typographique, Henri Rolland, to settle in Strasbourg. Together they make a request to the Magistrat of Strasbourg for the creation of a typefoundry, called Société Typographique de Strasbourg. At this time, there is no other type foundry in Strasbourg.\n\n1784-85. A first type specimen is printed: Épreuves des caractères de la société typographique de Strasbourg; Par Jacob élève de Baskerville. It is the first appearance of Jacob’s typeface based on Baskerville’s design, in 3 sizes. Jacob & Rolland are not totally honest here stating that Jacob had been “a pupil of Baskerville” (Jacob went to Birmingham 7 years after the death of Baskerville).\n\n1786. Rolland & Jacob want to diversify their activity, and are given the permission to print, in addition to the engraving activity. Apparently, printing in Strasbourg at the time was not something easy, as 5 other printers were already in business, protecting their territory. Rolland went to Paris to present their typefaces to the King, and they obtained the title of “imprimeur du Roi” in 1789. It was apparently too much for the other printers in Strasbourg, and they started\na lawsuit against Rolland & Jacob.\n\n1788-89. Despite these complications, a new type specimen is printed: Épreuves des caractères de Rolland et Jacob, à Strasbourg, including Jacob’s typeface now available in 6 sizes (Great Primer ou Gros Romain, English ou Saint-Augustin, Small-Pica ou Cicero, Long Primer ou Petit Romain, Parangon Petit oeil, Gros-Texte Petit oeil) all in roman and italic, among a few other typefaces, Vignettes and Filets. In 1789 however, Rolland & Jacob are ending their collaboration after a “disagreement”. In 1790, one of the five printers of Strasbourg, François-Xavier Levrault, took the opportunity to create a new partnership with Claude Jacob and a lawyer named Michel Thomassin, in order to continue to produce typefaces. A contract signed in January 12th and February 9th 1990 by Thomassin, Jacob, and Nicolas Levrault —the eldest of the Levrault family— states that the association would last 12 years, that Jacob would work for nobody else but the foundry, and that he would create all kinds of typefaces with a minimum of one font per year. The new punches and matrices would belong to the association, and the association would go by the name of Société typographique Levrault. The story of the printers Levrault is also a very long one, beginning as early as 1676. In fact, Levrault’s printing activities have now stopped but the group still exists today as Berger- Levrault. They now produce software. Back in 1790, the new Société typographique operated as an annex of the Levrault printing house. Its publications indicated that the text was typeset “Avec les caractères de Jacob”. Jacob had to produce these so-called “caractères de Jacob” on behalf of Levrault, but also to be sold to other printers in Strasbourg, in Alsace, in Lorraine, in Avignon, but also in Belgium, Switzerland and Germany. Levrault might have shut down the Société typographique between 1795 and 1800, and definitively integrated the type foundry to his printing facility. \n\n1800. A new type specimen is printed: Épreuves des caractères de la fonderie des Frères Levrault, in Strasbourg, and showing the “Caractères dans le genre de Baskerwille”. Jacob must have stopped working for Levrault earlier than in 1802 —he signed a 12-years contract in 1790—, as his name disappears. But the original source of his typeface, Baskerville, finally reappears, although spelled with a w instead of a v. We lose track of Claude Jacob at this point, but his design is preserved by Levrault.\n\n1815. The last known specimen printed by Levrault, Épreuves de la fonderie de François Georges Levrault, à Strasbourg, 1815 is still selling Jacob’s “Caractères dans le genre de Baskerwille”. In 1871, after the end of the Franco-Prussian War, Strasbourg is part of Imperial Germany and the Levrault decide to move to Nancy. Five years later, in 1876, a fire destroys the printing facility, and they have to build a new one from scratch. But despite all these difficulties, Jacob’s typeface survived and one finally finds it again in 1878, in a publication telling the long story of the Levrault, entitled Notice historique de l’Imprimerie Berger-Levrault & Cie, typesetted in “caractères genre Baskerwille (propriété de la Maison)”, as mentioned in the imprint.",

Its publications indicated that the text was typesetted “Avec les caractères de Jacob”. Jacob had to produce these so-called “caractères de Jacob” on behalf of Levrault, but also to be sold to other printers in Strasbourg, in Alsace, in Lorraine, in Avignon, but also in Belgium, Switzerland and Germany. Levrault might have shut down the Société typographique between 1795 and 1800, and definitively integrated the type foundry to his printing facility. \n\n1800. A new type specimen is printed: Épreuves des caractères de la fonderie des Frères Levrault, in Strasbourg, and showing the “Caractères dans le genre de Baskerwille”. Jacob must have stopped working for Levrault earlier than in 1802 —he signed a 12-years contract in 1790—, as his name disappears. But the original source of his typeface, Baskerville, finally reappears, although spelled with a w instead of a v. We lose track of Claude Jacob at this point, but his design is preserved by Levrault.\n\n1815. The last known specimen printed by Levrault, Épreuves de la fonderie de François Georges Levrault, à Strasbourg, 1815 is still selling Jacob’s “Caractères dans le genre de Baskerwille”. In 1871, after the end of the Franco-Prussian War, Strasbourg is part of Imperial Germany and the Levrault decide to move to Nancy. Five years later, in 1876, a fire destroys the printing facility, and they have to build a new one from scratch. But despite all these difficulties, Jacob’s typeface survived and one finally finds it again in 1878, in a publication telling the long story of the Levrault, entitled Notice historique de l’Imprimerie Berger-Levrault & Cie, typesetted in “caractères genre Baskerwille (propriété de la Maison)”, as mentioned in the imprint.",

The smaller optical sizes become more neutral and reflective of contemporary sans serifs, notably through the use of exaggerated ink traps.By blending iconic British and French designs with modern trends and tools, it aims to traverse a complex typographical and emotional landscape. At the same time, it’s so steeped in historical sources and references that it’s hard to call it anything but a re-interpretation of the same ideas but for a different purpose: trying to express visually what it feels like to move countries and rebuild, what it feels like to have a hybrid identity where you cannot be what you were and yet you can never truly be anybody else.To contribute, see github.com/ateliertriay/bricolage.",

    "description": "Cal Sans is a geometric sans-serif typeface designed for display, particularly large point sizes. It was created by Mark Davis for Cal.com by Peer Richelsen and Bailey Pumfleet, with interface design by Ciarán Hanrahan, and is open source. The design aims for a serious and geometric aesthetic, ensuring circular shapes throughout the “cal.com” lettering.To contribute, see github.com/calcom/font.Cal Sans is a geometric sans-serif tuned for display, that is, large point sizes. It is an Open Source typeface to adorn the headlines and interfaces of Cal.com, a company founded by Peer Richelsen and Bailey Pumfleet and interface design by Ciarán Hanrahan.The basis of Cal Sans is my initial answer to what my Futura would be. It fit well with Peer’s brief, for something serious and and geometric so that the letters of “cal.com” would have circular shapes throughout. It was decided early on that it be open source for all!As this design was created for display, and is currently a single static font, an unusual approach is taken for its texture and default typography. Letters are intentionally spaced to be extremely close for tight headlines “out of the box.” For smaller subheadings, positive letter spacing must be applied. There are currently no other Open Source geometric sanserifs geared as intentionally for “tight but not touching” typesetting—as it is more labor intensive to produce with accurate texture. But for typesetters, if they would letterspace another design as tight as Cal Sans, the results would not be as consistent.So, for end users, more flexibility is available when the tightest typesetting extreme edge case is gracefully addressed. One may create looser typesetting as needed.While the default design is fairly ahistorical, there are historical design options. Using Stylistic Set 01 (ss01), Futura-specific alternates can be deployed. Including diacritic variants, there are 48 alternates for this set.I give credit to Rasmus Andersson implementing in his design Inter Character Variants to offer more control in website typography. Cal Sans also employs this feature. There are six Character Variants in Cal Sans, for Cc (cv01), j (cv02), t (cv03), u (cv04), 0 (cv05), and 1 (cv06).In celebration of Futura’s geometrically extreme ligatures, Cal Sans has an experimental approach to ligatures, Stylistic Set 02 (ss02) is identical to ss01, but also combines eligible letters as historical Futura ligatures. This is included as a stylistic set and not as discretionary ligatures because default characters really do not match these historical ligatures. (But they were included anyway!)Probably the most novel OpenType feature of Cal Sans is its third Stylistic Set (ss03). The best way to exhibit the need of ss03 is to see how “tight but not touching” affects spacing with consecutive diagonals. Some designers would never want their letters to overlap or touch in a headline, or very large title.Diagonals’ corners are kerned from eachother, and some might say this causes more problems than the “stock” kerning solves. Such letter combinations aren’t…incredibly common. But they are not rare, nor is spacing letters in a way that is sometimes consistent a goal of mine. But, I see merits in both paths. So, ss03 overrides diagonal-to-diagonal kerning pairs with new ones that let diagonal corners “crash.”I don’t know of any other typefaces that has many kerning options, hopefully this feature is of use! Thanks to Tal Leming’s OpenType Cook Book for technical details.",

However in small sizes these gestures become less noticeable making it possible to set longer texts. The name \"Capriola\" means somersault in English.

Looking at the font in detail, the bottom halves of the glyphs have Transitive serifs while the upper halves conserve the Sans Serif terminals.  Other specific details can be seen in the a, g, and e glyphs, which have an Italic structure, not an Upright one.  In addition, the glyph for the letter r has a relatively closed instroke.The references used to develop this font were Bree from TypeTogether, Parisine de Porchez Typofonderie, and, undeniably, Ludovico Degli Arrighi's manuscript about the structure the \"humanistic cursive\" that is Convergence.Designed by Nicolas Silva (@zar_nicolas20) and John Vargas (@vargas74)",

Cormorant was conceived, drawn, spaced, kerned, programmed, interpolated, and produced in its entirety by Christian Thalmann of Catharsis Fonts. For an illustrated presentation and description of the family, please visit its Bēhance page.While this project was heavily inspired by Claude Garamont's immortal legacy, Christian did not use any specific font as a starting point or direct reference for the designs. Most glyphs were drawn from scratch; when he needed guidance on a specific character, he searched for the term Garamond and skimmed through the results for a general impression.He is grateful to the creative souls on the Typophile, TypeDrawers and Typografie forums, and Github, for a wealth of knowledge about type design, and for providing a large amount of excellent feedback on Cormorant during its development. He also thanks the tireless folks at Glyphs, in particular Rainer Erich Scheichelbauer of Schriftlabor and Georg Seifert.

David Hadash Formal is a modern digitization made from original large scale technical drawings for the typeface drawn by Ismar David.Google has worked with Monotype to release the 3 book weights (Regular, Medium and Bold) under the SIL Open Font License and create a new version for use by the public.This project includes working with the David Hadash sources to create a new version, that fits the requirements of Israeli instituions, since David is the official font for Israeli correspondence.Some glyphs were updated, such as the Sheqel symbol. It was redesigned to be recognizable by contemporary Hebrew readers, since the original Sheqel symbol is too far from today's standard.Latin characters from the Gentium typeface were derived and integrated to accommodate cases in which Latin and Hebrew characters will be used in tandem.Each font includes OpenType features required for diacritic marks (nikud) and Hebrew-specific uses, including alternative Hebrew-height numerals (available as Stylistic Set 1) an alternative \"Hebrew ampersand\" symbol designed by Ismar David (available in Stylistic Set 2) and an alternative Sheqel symbol designed by Ismar David (available in Stylistic Set 3.)Every effort was made to keep the original designs intact, and the type's original spacing is well preserved. However, several changes have been made to fit with David Libre's goal to be used as a free alternative to the David font commonly installed on PCs. In order to be compatible with documents previously set in the version of David bundled with Microsoft Windows, David Hadash's glyph size has been reduced by 12.5%. This was made to prevent cases in which documents previously typed in Microsoft's David to take up more pages and cause odd line breaks. Please note that this does not guarantee full compatibility with that David, only a close approximation.Diacritic marks have been repositioned. Biblical cantillation marks are not supported.The construction of David Libre was made by Meir Sadan, commissioned by Google for the Google Fonts project.The David Libre project is led by Meir Sadan, a type designer based in Tel Aviv, Israel.

When I start sketching I knew it would be a little less condensed than the original Empire because I wanted it to be used for use in titles, and combined with positive letter spacing it gives an elegant look to text. Although the original hasn't got a lowercase, I studied a lot of skyline typefaces and drew a fully original lowercase.I started with lowercase “o”, which isn't completely geometric, it is expanded to the outside, keeping the same whitespace through all weights. And this repeats all over the typeface, because the construction of all the characters was modular, based on that “o”; the “f” is designed to not meet any of the diacritics; and uppercase “A” has a traditional form, because I think this is more legible.",

From the early 1930s through World War II, there were about 200 professional hand letterers working in New York City alone. This occupation saw its demise with the advent of photo lettering, and after digital typography it became virtually extinct. The odd way in which the Bluemlein scripts were assembled and created - by collecting different signatures and then building complete alphabets from them - is a fascinating calligraphic adventure. Because the set of constructed designs looked nothing like the original signatures, fictitious names were assigned to the new script typefaces. The typeface styles were then showcased in Higgins Ink catalogs.Alejandro Paul and Sudtipos bring the Bluemlein scripts back to life in a set of expanded digital versions, reflecting the demands of today’s designer. Extreme care has been taken to render the original scripts authentically, keeping the fictitious names originally assigned to them by Bluemlein.",

It includes a comprehensive character set that lets you work with diverse European languages.This typeface family was designed for the output of inkjet printers. It was inspired by the concept of saving space in publishing texts without loss of height. This means it is a very condensed type.The visual advantage of Economica is that accomplishes this horizontal compression while keeping a strong personality. It is not a typical, neutral, sans serif. The open forms and tendency towards flattened curves allow it to be used in very small spaces while retaining high legibility.To contribute to the project contact Vicente Lamónaca.",

This feature was defined from the manuscripts of Jorge Alfredo Díaz Esteban, a writer who used a tool that can generate modulated strokes. This means the stroke width varies due to the pressure of the pen on the paper, and this quality allows the font to have a presence on the page that makes texts more dynamic. The precise level of contrast was decided by experimenting with various 'colors' of density that emerge in text settings. This allows Esteban to achieve good performance even in medium and low quality prints and as a web font.",

Frank Rühl was designed in 1908 by Rafael Frank in collaboration with Auto Rühl of the C. F. Rühl foundry of Leipzig. A final version was released in 1910. Many Israeli books, newspapers and magazines use Frank Rühl as their main body text typeface.Made to accommodate the growing need for typefaces in secular Hebrew writings, the typeface was fitted to modern printing demands and designed to be readable in longform text, with and without vowel marks. Frank Rühl has Sephardi proportions (mem-height is approximately 4½ stroke widths), and is based roughly on Venetian typefaces used by printer Daniel Bomberg. Frank wrote of his design that he wishes to combine the simpleness of Antiqua with the \"pleasantness\" of Fraktur, leading him to \"quieten\" the letterforms by reducing the contrast between its thin and thick strokes.This newly designed revival by Yanek Iontef is a family of 7 weights, Light to Black (the original typeface had only one) and in November 2022, it became variable and offers a larger choice of weights.To contribute, see github.com/fontef/frankruhllibre.",

During the 1990s the magazine and font catalogue Emigre was at the public front of typeface design, and was a place where computer fonts with this same look appeared.I think Geo expresses both the directness of some of the 1920s faces and the rather disingenuous consumerist thrust of the 1980s and 1990s descendants of theirs.",

This typeface was designed to provide an effective textual communication tool primarily for Urdu readers on digital platforms and in print. In Gulzar, the aim has been to produce a typeface which is legible at text sizes and suitable for sustained reading. The first phase of this project involved conducting research into the history of Urdu digital typefaces from the early 1980s. The design of Gulzar was inspired by carefully collected specimens of Urdu calligraphy and lettering which were closely studied to achieve an accurate representation of the Urdu flavour of the Nasta’liq style.\n\n    Once the Nasta’liq design was firmly established, a proposal was made for a Latin counterpart that took inspiration from two eminent humanistic references: the versatile and sturdy proportions of Robert Granjon’s types, coupled with the sharp and distinctive feel of Hendrik van den Keere’s work. The Latin letterforms thus feature some subtle references to their calligraphic roots and echo the contrast present in the Nasta’liq, while remaining embedded in their classical typographic proportions.\n\n    Gulzar is not the first OpenType Nasta’liq typeface, but it is the first Nasta’liq type for which an original Latin counterpart was designed. It covers all the required transliterations characters to transcribe Arabic, Persian and Urdu languages.\n\n    You can read more about the inspiration, design, and engineering of Gulzar at gulzarfont.org.\n\n    To contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/Gulzar/.",

The distinct and sharp, quirky and attention seeking details inspired Minjoo Ham to use it for a rather uncommon revival project and turn it into a robust, contemporary typeface. Once the Hangeul was finished, Mark Frömberg took on the challenge to translate the characteristics to the Latin design. A lively exploration into the possible and impossible began. Hahmlet is great for any kind of typesetting, print or screen but also a perfect eyecatcher for signage and poster designs. We highly recommend to use it for Hangeul and Latin bilingual typography.\n\nTo contribute to the project, visit https://github.com/hyper-type/hahmlet/",

From the early 1930s through World War II, there were about 200 professional hand letterers working in New York City alone. This occupation saw its demise with the advent of photo lettering, and after digital typography it became virtually extinct. The odd way in which the Bluemlein scripts were assembled and created - by collecting different signatures and then building complete alphabets from them - is a fascinating calligraphic adventure. Because the set of constructed designs looked nothing like the original signatures, fictitious names were assigned to the new script typefaces. The typeface styles were then showcased in Higgins Ink catalogs.Alejandro Paul and Sudtipos bring the Bluemlein scripts back to life in a set of expanded digital versions, reflecting the demands of today’s designer. Extreme care has been taken to render the original scripts authentically, keeping the fictitious names originally assigned to them by Bluemlein.",

It's the kind of font that doesn't just speak; it shouts, honks, and sings with its varied styles, dynamic shape-shifting and use of colorv1 technology.\n\nHonk reflects the essence of India's vibrant spirit, and it does so with an audacious flair.

It is a typographic adventure you won't forget!\n\nThis project is designed, engineered and maintained by Ek Type; a collective of type designers focused on designing contemporary Indian typefaces. Honk is designed by Noopur Datye and Yesha Goshar, and engineered by Sidharth Jaishankar and Girish Dalvi, emojis are designed by Athul Jayaraman and testing is done by Taresh Vohra and team Ek Type.

For instance, a button's size remains constant even when the font weight increases during a hover state. Similarly, making a part of a sentence bolder will not push the letters to the next line.\n\n    Calibrated for both display and text applications, Host Grotesk has low contrast stroke modulation and closed terminals that complement the straightforward construction of its letterforms, making it an excellent choice for digital media. The proportions are balanced between a generous geometric sans and a compact grotesque, suitable for both display sizes and small body copy.\n\n    The Host Grotesk family is built on Jonny Pinhorn's beloved Poppins (Indian Type Foundry, 2020). While most letters are reworked and modified for the new look and duplexed proportions, Poppins' soft and approachable essence remains visible. A reliable and cohesive type family for user interfaces, branding, and communication materials, combining the contemporary workhorse category with the elevated functionality of uni-width proportions.",

    "description": "The idea of geometric typefaces with a look reminiscent of the machinery, technology, and interior design of the 1950s originated in Eurostile family by Aldo Novarese and Alessandro Butti (1952).Iceland is a modular square-shaped webfont by Victor Kharyk with a cold brutal character designed with the intention to perform well on screen starting from low resolutions. For this purpose the strokes are deliberatly kept vertical and diagonal cuts have a 45° angle, outlines are rounded.Features like wide proportions and generous x-height are introduced for better legibility. Unconventional and simplified letterforms like k, f, r aid readability at small sizes. While at display sizes they add a crisp and sharp impression.Uppercase letters are decently heavier compared to lowercase as a tribute to the old typographic tradition. This way uppercase is easily distinguished from lowercase, and allows scaling down to be used as Small Caps.Because of its ascetic modular character and squarish proportions Iceland webfont is easily integrated in modular grids and logotypes.",

Since 1668 he spent his life creating a ‘learned press’ in Oxford, endowed with invaluable equipment, setting a high standard for the future of his publishing. He wrote: \"The foundation of all successe must be layd in doing things well, and I am sure that will not be don with English letters\" (to Jenkins, 2 Dec. 1672). So he collectected types available in the foreign market: mainly France, Holland and Germany. Fell decided to develop types in its own ‘workhouse’ too.Peter De Walpergen became his personal type-founder. Says Harry Carter in “THE FELL TYPES. What has been done in and about them” (Oxford University Press, New York, 1968): \"He was born at Frankfurt am Main, descended from a Protestant refugee from Antwerp. He was engaged by the Dutch East India Company in 1671 to work as a type-founder and printer in Java. The comparative crudity of his letter design makes it seems unlikely that he had been trained to cut punches.\"John Fell entrusted him with the cut of the larger bodies: Great Primer Roman and Italic; Double Pica Roman and Italic; French Canon Roman and Italic; Three Lines Pica Roman. De Walpergen cut other types and letters for existing types to be harmonized with the larger bodies. Commented Morison: \"The design of these large Fell Types is difficult to characterize and impossible wholly to approve. It has some affinity with the Dutch work of the second half of the seventeenth century, especially with the bigger size of type shown in the Widow Elsevier’s specimen-sheet of types attributed to Christoffel van Dyck; but De Walpergen went much further in the contrasting weight of thick and thin strokes and his design has crudities about it of which Van Dyck would not have been capable.\"In 1686 John Fell died. In his “will” he bequeathed the entire collection of type to the University of Oxford. Remembers Morison: \"This entire collection of ‘founding Materialls of Punchions Matrices Moulds’ was ‘got together’ by John Fell ‘and others at great expense’. Fell’s instructions that they ‘be carefully kept together’ by his executors were duly observed. The Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Oxford honourably played their part in sustaining the interests of ‘learning and printing’ and thus the collection was not dissipated but manteined entire.\"",

Since 1668 he spent his life creating a ‘learned press’ in Oxford, endowed with invaluable equipment, setting a high standard for the future of his publishing. He wrote: \"The foundation of all successe must be layd in doing things well, and I am sure that will not be don with English letters\" (to Jenkins, 2 Dec. 1672). So he collectected types available in the foreign market: mainly France, Holland and Germany. Fell decided to develop types in its own ‘workhouse’ too.Peter De Walpergen became his personal type-founder. Says Harry Carter in “THE FELL TYPES. What has been done in and about them” (Oxford University Press, New York, 1968): \"He was born at Frankfurt am Main, descended from a Protestant refugee from Antwerp. He was engaged by the Dutch East India Company in 1671 to work as a type-founder and printer in Java. The comparative crudity of his letter design makes it seems unlikely that he had been trained to cut punches.\"John Fell entrusted him with the cut of the larger bodies: Great Primer Roman and Italic; Double Pica Roman and Italic; French Canon Roman and Italic; Three Lines Pica Roman. De Walpergen cut other types and letters for existing types to be harmonized with the larger bodies. Commented Morison: \"The design of these large Fell Types is difficult to characterize and impossible wholly to approve. It has some affinity with the Dutch work of the second half of the seventeenth century, especially with the bigger size of type shown in the Widow Elsevier’s specimen-sheet of types attributed to Christoffel van Dyck; but De Walpergen went much further in the contrasting weight of thick and thin strokes and his design has crudities about it of which Van Dyck would not have been capable.\"In 1686 John Fell died. In his “will” he bequeathed the entire collection of type to the University of Oxford. Remembers Morison: \"This entire collection of ‘founding Materialls of Punchions Matrices Moulds’ was ‘got together’ by John Fell ‘and others at great expense’. Fell’s instructions that they ‘be carefully kept together’ by his executors were duly observed. The Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Oxford honourably played their part in sustaining the interests of ‘learning and printing’ and thus the collection was not dissipated but manteined entire.\"",

However, in practice, the pixel size is determined by the properties of the yarn in use. Scale is determined by the weight of the yarn as well as the number of pixels that make up the height of each letter. In this collection, the number following the typeface's name indicates the height of the capital letters for that typeface.These typefaces were designed with machine knitting in mind, but could be used for hand knitting, needlework, bedazzling, or many other textile crafts.Note: For Fair Isle knitting, you need to beware of floats and plan accordingly, as always.Each typeface has a “Regular” and “Charted” version, and some include multiple scales so you can fit type on your knits, no matter the project's size.

Both these, and the stroke terminals in the Devanagari letterforms are generally rounded in Karma’s design.Karma’s characters are economic in width, and the Latin sports a tall x-height. Although the knotted terminals in the Devanagari letterforms are closed, the general feeling of the Devanagari character set is open and airy.

The typeface symbolizes the principles of communication,\n  wisdom, knowledge, prudence, and connection. \n\nThe goal of the typeface is a celebration of African heritage while\nmeeting contemporary design standards. Adinkra symbols express themes\nconnected to the history, beliefs, and philosophy of the Asante people,\noften with proverbial meanings that signify wisdom. These symbols also\ndescribe historical events, human and animal behavior, plant forms,\nand object shapes. \n\nDrawing on this Adinkra symbol, the design connects with Africa's rich\ngraphical heritage. The creation of Matemasie was a journey to craft a\ntypeface that resonates with the spirit of Africa, drawing deeply from\nits roots.\n\nThe design process involved connecting the past and present,\npreserving the essence of African heritage for future\ngenerations. Matemasie celebrates the harmony between tradition and\ninnovation, reflecting the balance embodied by the \"Mate Masie\"\nsymbol.\n\nTraditionally, the Mate Masie symbol is represented by four linked\nears—two on top and two on the bottom. This 2-by-2 arrangement is a\nfundamental aspect of the symbol, signifying balance and rhythm, when\nit is presented in traditional designs. This rhythmic balance played a\ncrucial role in developing the letterforms of the Matemasie font. \nBy integrating this cultural structure into the digital design,\nMatemasie stays deeply connected to its cultural roots, preserving the\nessence of the symbol while adapting it for contemporary use.\n\nThe design process aimed to respect and reflect the traditional\nsymbolism, allowing the modern typeface to serve as both a functional\ntool and a cultural tribute. The typeface captures both the artistic\nand spiritual essence of \"Mate Masie\" through its unique typographic\nfeatures.\n\nMatemasie is more than a collection of letters; it is a testament to\nthe rich mosaic of African culture and tradition. Like the symbol that inspired it,\nMatemasie whispers stories of ancient wisdom and caution through its\nelegant curves. It is hoped that Matemasie's story will continue to\nevolve with various styles, inspiring typographers to explore the\ndepths of African culture and wisdom.",

From the early 1930s through World War II, there were about 200 professional hand letterers working in New York City alone. This occupation saw its demise with the advent of photo lettering, and after digital typography it became virtually extinct. The odd way in which the Bluemlein scripts were assembled and created - by collecting different signatures and then building complete alphabets from them - is a fascinating calligraphic adventure. Because the set of constructed designs looked nothing like the original signatures, fictitious names were assigned to the new script typefaces. The typeface styles were then showcased in Higgins Ink catalogs.Alejandro Paul and Sudtipos bring the Bluemlein scripts back to life in a set of expanded digital versions, reflecting the demands of today’s designer. Extreme care has been taken to render the original scripts authentically, keeping the fictitious names originally assigned to them by Bluemlein.",

The letters on these wooden trail and directional signs are a system of paths, points, and curves that a router follows. The router’s \"bit\" follows the path and gives the letters its stroke weight or thickness when engraving a sign. National Park Typeface walks along the path of both honoring the quirky nature of the forms being created by a router bit and optimizing the forms to work in a variety of sizes and languages for print, web, and mobile platforms.The design of each character begins with a vector skeleton, represented by a series of coordinates that a router would typically interpret and carve into a wooden sign. From there adjustments were made to each skeleton to ensure comfortable legibility at different weights, and we also incorporate optical adjustments where the capabilities of an analog router falls short. The result is a typeface that stays true to its unique inspiration, maintaining its inviting warmth and distinctive character. It can be effectively utilized across a wide range of applications while preserving the essence that makes it truly special.",

In more classical or personal documents, a stiff, sober, modern and down-to-earth italic will never work. And in many essays, some of the fancier italics look ridiculous.

It has a large x-height, ample proportions, big serifs and large apertures that allow the letters to be clear, even at small sizes on low resolution screens. The capitals are unusually small, allowing them to be used as substitutes for small caps. (It's recommended to add some tracking if used in this way.)One major feature is the break in the internal curves of round characters. While this break makes some interesting forms at large sizes, their true purpose is to help make the counterforms more open at small sizes by allowing straighter stems. This reasoning is famously known as W.A. Dwiggins' “M-formula.”The italics were designed to contrast with the roman styles while maintaining good legibility. The true italic forms also have big counterforms and simple curves.The fonts have been manually hinted to get the best possible rasterization in Windows.The Noticia font family project is envisioned as 18 different fonts styles, with text, condensed, display and sans variants, different weights and including italic versions, all designed and hinted to work well on computer and mobile devices screens.",

Among those, there were mostly all-caps sans-serif types\n    played as descriptions or the store's names themself.

Playfair can be interpolated in three dimensions: Width, Weight and Optical Size.The optical size axis is the most extreme of the axes. Along that axis you can seamlessly change the letterforms from the extremely small Agate (5pt) to the extremely big Needlepoint (1200pt). The Agate has a very low contrast between the thickest and thinnest parts of its strokes, in fact the contrast is even slightly negative, meaning the the horisontal strokes are heavier than the vertical strokes. At the other end the Needlepoint is as high contrast as practically possible. The thinnest strokes are but a single unit wide, meaning that if you were to typeset in 1000 points using a Needlepoint weight, the resulting thinnest strokes would be one point wide. The weight axis adds a second dimension by allowing you to seamlessly change from a light regular to a dark black.An update in June 2023 slightly modifies the width axis, giving the text a narrower appearance.In February 2025, a glyphset update improves the language support by adding African.To contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/Playfair.",

    "description": "Playpen Sans was designed by TypeTogether after over two years of primary research into handwriting education for Latin-based languages, available at primarium.info.\n\n    It is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to ExtraBold (800) and supports three different writing systems—Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic—that cover over 700 Latin languages, including Vietnamese and 619 Sub-Saharan African languages, 54 Cyrillic languages, and Greek, along with 26 emoji. \n    The Playpen Sans superfamily also includes an Arabic (Playpen Sans Arabic), Devanagari (Playpen Sans Deva), Hebrew (Playpen Sans Hebrew), and Thai (Playpen Sans Thai) fonts that expand the language support of the system.\n\n    Playpen Sans provides seven different glyphs for each character that are automatically applied as you type, using a built-in shuffler that both ensures variety and avoids repetition. This adds to the overall organic, spontaneous, and authentic feel of the handwritten style.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/TypeTogether/Playpen-Sans\n\n    Watch the video on Youtube\n\n    Some typefaces do more than one thing well, and others excel at just one thing. The Playpen Sans font family excels at imitating casual handwriting with a completely natural look — the aesthetic form of something made by hand – combined with all the functionality of a professional typeface.\n\n    The font world has a general tension between what’s organic and what’s digital. When scribbling a quick note, written letters have slight differences, but all look similar because they come from the same person. Digital typefaces are instead almost always very consistent — each character is exactly the same, every time you type it.\n    \n    The goal of a typeface that is both casual in look and digital in nature is to appear authentically human within the bounds of digital technology: A typeface with a set of characters that are “the same, but different” that carries the authenticity which everyone craves. The main problem with typical casual fonts is not having enough alternate characters to look real. When a family has more than one alternate, another problem arises in controlling how and when a character gets replaced.\n    \n    To solve these problems, Playpen Sans was designed with seven versions of each character, plus a novel and automatic shuffler, so no single shape is repeated in close proximity. The result is text with spontaneous inconsistencies that feel fun and organic… all the benefits of a modern, professional typeface that looks natural.\n    \n    The family was made for non-designers, and it shines within short, informal settings: greeting cards and invitations; casual signs; fun documents, and of course, children’s books and educational materials, comic books, and graphic novels. The straight and curved endings for ‘i, l, y’, the two-story ‘a’, and optional shapes for ‘f, G, I, M’ are notable features. \n    \n    Playpen Sans combines technological and aesthetic values, showing the best of both worlds with digital capabilities and a casual, handmade look. Is it spontaneous? Is it authentic? Thankfully, yes, and yes.\n\n    Greek and Cyrillic follow the same principles as Latin, giving the idea that they are all written by the same person. All the writing systems approach letterform construction with casual and continuous strokes; typical stroke boundaries are not always respected due to the relaxed mood of writing; and the in-strokes and out-strokes allow for a natural transition from one letter to the other. Each is a set of clear letterforms that are easy to write and recognize. The design forms a bridge between handwritten and typographic letters, friendly to both little readers and adults.\n\nPlaypen Sans has emojis for breezy and encouraging uses, that each match the eight named weights of the Latin.\nFind here the list of all the emojis available.\nYou can copy and paste them into your document editor when using the font. 😉\n\n    🌞 \n    😍 \n    ☠ \n    ☹ \n    😉 \n    ✏ \n    📖 \n    🏠 \n    ✍ \n    🧩 \n    🦖 \n    🪐 \n    ✈ \n    🌠 \n    🎂 \n    🎨 \n    📣 \n    👆 \n    👍 \n    👎 \n    🎯 \n    🪫 \n    ✅ \n    ❌ \n    🏅 \n    🦄",

Designed with non-designers in mind, it shines in informal settings like greeting cards, invitations, children’s books, and graphic novels. Its clarifying features, such as straight and curved endings for certain letters and optional shapes, add to its versatility.\n\n    Playpen Sans combines the best of both worlds: the aesthetic charm of handwritten text and the technological capabilities of a digital font. It’s spontaneous, authentic, and effortlessly bridges the gap between the organic and the digital.\n\nPlaypen Sans has emojis for breezy and encouraging uses, that each match the eight named weights of the Latin.\nFind here the list of all the emojis available.\nYou can copy and paste them into your document editor when using the font. 😉\n\n    🌞 \n    😍 \n    ☠ \n    ☹ \n    😉 \n    ✏ \n    📖 \n    🏠 \n    ✍ \n    🧩 \n    🦖 \n    🪐 \n    ✈ \n    🌠 \n    🎂 \n    🎨 \n    📣 \n    👆 \n    👍 \n    👎 \n    🎯 \n    🪫 \n    ✅ \n    ❌ \n    🏅 \n    🦄",

It includes guidelines on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders. These guides provide a visual aid for primary school children that helps young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assists them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.\n\n\tThe Dutch-French language divide in Belgium, a phenomenon with roots stretching\n\tback to the Middle Ages, continues to be relevant in the country today.\n\tTraditions of handwriting education exemplify this circumstance and reflect the\n\tcountry's historical ties to France and the Netherlands. Regardless of the\n\thandwriting model adopted, students learn print-style script letters in\n\tkindergarten and progress to connected letters in primary school. In Flanders,\n\tthere is a preference for\n\t\n    sloped continuous cursive writing, reminiscent of Dutch handwriting models, whereas the French-speaking\n\tcommunity in the Walloon region opts for upright cursive writing, a style that\n\tenjoys popularity in France. This diversity in handwriting education is a\n\tdirect response to Belgium's rich linguistic culture, leading to the\n\tintroduction of a second official language early in the school years.\n\n\tTo contribute, see\n\t\n    github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\n\tGuidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter/word spacing.

    "description": "The most prevalent style of handwriting taught in Chile is known as\n\t‘letra ligada’, or joined letters. This form of cursive handwriting is\n\tintroduced to children as early as 6 years old, either alongside print letters\n\tor as a standalone style. It can be seen as a slantless variant of\n\tEnglish roundhand, a calligraphic style that emerged in England, gaining widespread popularity\n\tin the 18th century, but Chilean type designers note that, while there are\n\tstructural similarities between the two styles, there are also notable\n\tdifferences. For instance, letra ligada typically features shorter\n\tascenders and descenders, and its uppercase letters are less ornate. This\n\tdivergence is present in both contemporary typographic and calligraphic\n\texamples.\n\n\tPlaywrite Chile is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to\n\tRegular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.\n\tIt has a single-weight sibling with Guides, \n\tPlaywrite CL Guides, \n\tdesigned to harmonize seamlessly with this main font while providing a \n\tvisual aid for primary school children.\n\n\tTo contribute, see\n\t\n    github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\n\tThis upright continuous cursive features a mix of uppercase styles. Letters\n\tlike 'A' and 'N' are plain and cursive, whereas others such as 'Q' and 'T' are\n\tmore decorative and intricate. The lowercase letters have medium-length\n\textenders with loops and are characterized by their rounded forms and slow\n\tstroke speed. The letter 'q' is distinguished by a mirrored loop on its\n\tdescender. The 'o' includes a knot, and the letters 'm', 'n', 'v', 'w', 'y',\n\tand 'z' begin with curved entry strokes.\n\n\tPlaywrite Chile appears in font menus with a two-letter country code ‘CL’,\n\tPlaywrite CL, and features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and\n\tRegular.\n\t\n\tThe download .zip file includes the variable font and standard static ttf fonts\n\tfor each style.\n\n\tThe Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a\n\tgroundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current\n\tpractice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.\n\tThis typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating\n\tlocalized libre fonts.

    "description": "Playwrite Chile Guides is a single-weight font companion that harmonizes seamlessly with the main family, Playwrite Chile. It includes guidelines on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders. These guides provide a visual aid for primary school children that helps young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assists them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.\n\n\tThe most prevalent style of handwriting taught in Chile is known as\n\t‘letra ligada’, or joined letters. This form of cursive handwriting is\n\tintroduced to children as early as 6 years old, either alongside print letters\n\tor as a standalone style. It can be seen as a slantless variant of\n\tEnglish roundhand, a calligraphic style that emerged in England, gaining widespread popularity\n\tin the 18th century, but Chilean type designers note that, while there are\n\tstructural similarities between the two styles, there are also notable\n\tdifferences. For instance, letra ligada typically features shorter\n\tascenders and descenders, and its uppercase letters are less ornate. This\n\tdivergence is present in both contemporary typographic and calligraphic\n\texamples.\n\n\tTo contribute, see\n\t\n    github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\n\tGuidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter/word spacing. To create a versatile tool for teachers when designing practice sheets that feature guidelines without corresponding letters, the underscore is used as a key character.

This model was officially ratified by the\n\teducation ministry of erstwhile Czechoslovakia in 1932 and underwent its last\n\trevision in 1978. The second model, Comenia Script, features unjoined letters\n\tand was endorsed by the ministry in 2012. The national curriculum, which was\n\tlast published in 2013, provides no further prescriptions about handwriting,\n\tand as a result, schools have the autonomy to select either model for\n\tinstruction.\n\n\tTo contribute, see\n\t\n    github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\n\tGuidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter/word spacing. To create a versatile tool for teachers when designing practice sheets that feature guidelines without corresponding letters, the underscore is used as a key character. In Playwrite Guides fonts the underscore prints only the guidelines, and matches the width of the normal word space.\n\n    Find the detailed characteristics of this country's Model in Playwrite Česko.\n\n\tPlaywrite Česko Guides appears in font menus with a two-letter country code ‘CZ’,\n\tPlaywrite CZ Guides, and features a single Regular weight.\n\t\n\tThe download .zip file includes the static font for this guided version.\n\n\tThe Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a\n\tgroundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current\n\tpractice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.\n\tThis typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating\n\tlocalized libre fonts.

They draw from\n\tthe ideas of the Italic Handwriting Revival movement of the early 20th century,\n\tand the work of its proponents. Alfred Fairbank (1895–1982) proposed modern\n\titalic writing, based on chancery models, as a new approach to teaching\n\thandwriting with the aim of simplification and faster writing speed.

Of the twenty-three methods described in the National Handwriting\n\tAssociation’s 2013 guide to writing methods for teaching, thirteen were\n\tfully joined or\n\tsemi-joined modern cursive styles.

It features short, loopless ascenders and descenders, with\n\tsimplified print-like uppercase letters. Notable characteristics include an\n\topen 'G' without a crossbar and an 'M' with plain legs. The lowercase 'f' has a\n\tcurved descending stroke, and the 'q' is distinguished by a flick in its\n\tdescender. True to this style, there are no curved entry strokes, and letters\n\tending in a right-to-left stroke, such as 'b', 'p', 'g', and 's', do not\n\tconnect to the following letter.\n\n\tPlaywrite England SemiJoined appears in font menus with a two-letter country\n\tcode ‘GB’ and an ‘S’ for the SemiJoined, Playwrite GB S.

From\n\tClass 1 onwards, students are taught to add exit strokes to letters and then\n\tconnect them to achieve a cursive hand.\n\n\tTo contribute, see\n\t\n    github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\n\tGuidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter/word spacing. To create a versatile tool for teachers when designing practice sheets that feature guidelines without corresponding letters, the underscore is used as a key character. In Playwrite Guides fonts the underscore prints only the guidelines, and matches the width of the normal word space.\n\n    Find the detailed characteristics of this country's Model in Playwrite Ireland.\n\n\tPlaywrite Ireland appears in font menus with a two-letter country code ‘IE’,\n\tPlaywrite IE Guides, and features a single Regular weight.\n\t\n\tThe download .zip file includes the static font for this guided version.\n\n\tThe Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a\n\tgroundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current\n\tpractice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.\n\tThis typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating\n\tlocalized libre fonts.

    "description": "Italy holds an important place in the historical development of handwriting\n\tstyles. Handwriting produced in the Latin script finds its roots in the models\n\tproduced during the Italian Renaissance. The most prevalent form of handwriting\n\ttaught in Italy is an upright cursive style developed in the early to mid-20th\n\tcentury, which, according to handwriting expert Francesco Ascoli, was\n\tprescribed in the country’s national guidelines in 1945.\n\n\tAt the beginning of the 21st century, the decline in the quality of handwriting\n\tin Italy caught the attention of the educational community. To rectify this\n\tsituation, educators and handwriting experts started to explore different ways\n\tto improve instruction in primary schools by revamping approaches and resources\n\tfor\n\t\n    traditional handwriting\n\teducation, or introducing new teaching schemes. The\n\tScrittura Corsiva modern cursive project has gained significant\n\trecognition among the latter.\n\n\tPlaywrite Italia Moderna is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100)\n\tto Regular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.\n\tIt has a single-weight sibling with Guides, \n\tPlaywrite IT Moderna Guides, \n\tdesigned to harmonize seamlessly with this main font while providing a \n\tvisual aid for primary school children.\n\n\tTo contribute, see\n\t\n    github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\n\tThis is a fully joined modern cursive, completely upright, with short ascenders\n\tand descenders. it has simplified print style capital letters. Identity traits:\n\tIt has serifs and 'M' has splain legs. Lowercases use descender loops to\n\tconnect with the next letter in 'f', 'g', 'j' and 'y'. 'p' and 'b' have closed\n\tbowls, 'k' is written with two strokes, and 'f' is missing its top loop.\n\n\tPlaywrite Italia Moderna appears in font menus with a two-letter country code\n\t‘IT‘ and a the word ‘Moderna‘, Playwrite IT Moderna.

This poses a challenge in a country with\n\tlimited resources and great linguistic diversity.

As a result, teacher training and educational\n\tresources are required for several languages.\n\n\tIn the past, before the widespread use of computers, there was greater emphasis\n\ton handwriting.

Some uppercase letters, such as\n\tthe 'G', 'L', and 'Z', have decorative and complex cursive shapes.\n\n\tPlaywrite Nigeria Modern appears in font menus with a two-letter country code\n\t‘NG’ and the word ‘Modern’, Playwrite NG Modern.

It includes guidelines on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders. These guides provide a visual aid for primary school children that helps young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assists them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.\n\n\tIn Nigeria, there is an emphasis on students receiving instruction in the\n\tlanguage they hear and use every day. This poses a challenge in a country with\n\tlimited resources and great linguistic diversity. Apart from four widely spoken\n\tlanguages — Hausa, Igbo, Yoruba and English — there are hundreds of regional\n\tlanguages as well as dialects. As a result, teacher training and educational\n\tresources are required for several languages.\n\n\tIn the past, before the widespread use of computers, there was greater emphasis\n\ton handwriting. Today, while private schools with more resources may adopt\n\tforeign models like \n    Nelson Handwriting, \n    public schools face financial constraints, impacting their ability to prioritize \n    handwriting education. Given these circumstances, the handwriting style learned \n    by students is often influenced by the habits of their parents and teachers, \n    and they end up\tmimicking what they see around them.\n\n\tTo contribute, see\n\t\n    github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\n\tGuidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter/word spacing. To create a versatile tool for teachers when designing practice sheets that feature guidelines without corresponding letters, the underscore is used as a key character. In Playwrite Guides fonts the underscore prints only the guidelines, and matches the width of the normal word space.\n\n    Find the detailed characteristics of this country's Model in Playwrite Nigeria Modern.\n\n\tPlaywrite Nigeria Modern Guides appears in font menus with a two-letter country code\n\t‘NG’ and the word ‘Modern’, Playwrite NG Modern Guides, and features a single Regular weight.\n\t\n\tThe download .zip file includes the static font for this guided version.\n\n\tThe Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a\n\tgroundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current\n\tpractice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.\n\tThis typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating\n\tlocalized libre fonts.

These guides provide a visual aid for primary school children that helps young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assists them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.\n\n\tThe style of handwriting currently taught in New Zealand is specified in\n\tTeaching Handwriting, a Ministry of Education publication, which was developed\n\tin response to teachers’ requests for guidance on the style of handwriting that\n\tshould be taught in primary school. Teachers and schools usually create their\n\town resources for handwriting instruction based on the style advocated in this\n\tdocument. It was first released in 1985 and again in digital format in 2008.\n\tEven though Teaching Handwriting outlines a progressive handwriting system that\n\tadvances from simplified print script to cursive writing, sometimes teachers\n\twill not teach the latter if it is not practical given their students' learning\n\tlevels and other curriculum needs.\n\n\tTo contribute, see\n\t\n    github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\n\tGuidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter/word spacing. To create a versatile tool for teachers when designing practice sheets that feature guidelines without corresponding letters, the underscore is used as a key character.

It includes guidelines on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders. These guides provide a visual aid for primary school children that helps young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assists them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.\n\n\tThe primary school curriculum, published by the Ministry of Education, Science\n\tand Technology, and the Tanzania Institute of Education (TIE), was last updated\n\tin 2015. The first section, centered on the first two years of primary\n\teducation (Standards 1 and 2) focuses on developing competencies in reading,\n\twriting and arithmetic. The TIE also publishes a syllabus that provides\n\tspecific guidelines for the implementation of the curriculum. The syllabus\n\tstates that students should learn print style letters first followed by cursive\n\twriting, but no models or samples are shown.\n\n\tIn practice, Standard 1 students learn an almost upright precursive and\n\tprogress to a fully-joined cursive from Standard 2 onwards. The primers\n\tavailable through the free online library services supply detailed samples and\n\tpractice materials that are used in classrooms.\n\n\tTo contribute, see\n\t\n    github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\n\tGuidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter/word spacing.

    "description": "In Vietnam, an official handwriting model for teaching in primary schools was\n\tadopted in 2002. It is called the mẫu chữ thảo tiếng việt, or\n\tVietnamese official cursive script, and has been in use from academic\n\tyear 2002-03 onwards. Based on this model, students learn to write in both\n\tupright and (optionally) sloped cursive letters, without ever being taught\n\tprint letters. Nevertheless, they do practice drawing the basic strokes that\n\tmake up letters in preparation. Handwriting education happens between Grades 1\n\tto 3, and while students are introduced to writing using a pencil, they\n\tgraduate to writing with fountain pens while they are still in primary school.\n\n\tPlaywrite Việt Nam is a variable font with a weight range from Thin (100) to\n\tRegular (400), and supports over 150 Latin-based languages.\n\tIt has a single-weight sibling with Guides, \n\tPlaywrite VN Guides, \n\tdesigned to harmonize seamlessly with this main font while providing a \n\tvisual aid for primary school children.\n\n\tTo contribute, see\n\t\n    github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\n\tThe model follows the structure and proportions of the upright, monolinear\n\tversion of the Vietnamese official cursive script. These are the versions that\n\tare prioritized for teaching, while others may be introduced if the situation\n\tis conducive. The letter shapes derive from the French traditional vertical\n\tcursive writing, featuring long ascenders and descenders and round and fully\n\tjoined lowercases. Letters 'b', 'r', 'v', and 'w' make use of knots to change\n\tthe stroke direction, 'n' and 'm' have curved entry strokes and 'x' is created\n\tby means of two mirrored curves. Notable upper case features are the triangular\n\tyet decorative shapes of 'A', 'V' and 'W', and an 'S' with an upright spine.\n\n\tPlaywrite Việt Nam appears in font menus with a two-letter country code ‘VN’,\n\tPlaywrite VN, and features four styles: Thin, ExtraLight, Light, and\n\tRegular.\n\t\n\tThe download .zip file includes the variable font and standard static ttf fonts\n\tfor each style.\n\n\tThe Playwrite school fonts are based on the findings of Primarium, a\n\tgroundbreaking educational effort that documents the history and current\n\tpractice of handwriting models taught to primary school students worldwide.\n\tThis typographic engine serves teachers, educators, and parents by generating\n\tlocalized libre fonts.

It includes guidelines on the baseline, x-height, ascenders, and descenders. These guides provide a visual aid for primary school children that helps young learners grasp the proportions of letterforms and assists them in drawing letters with confidence and accuracy.\n\n\tIn Vietnam, an official handwriting model for teaching in primary schools was\n\tadopted in 2002. It is called the mẫu chữ thảo tiếng việt, or\n\tVietnamese official cursive script, and has been in use from academic\n\tyear 2002-03 onwards. Based on this model, students learn to write in both\n\tupright and (optionally) sloped cursive letters, without ever being taught\n\tprint letters. Nevertheless, they do practice drawing the basic strokes that\n\tmake up letters in preparation. Handwriting education happens between Grades 1\n\tto 3, and while students are introduced to writing using a pencil, they\n\tgraduate to writing with fountain pens while they are still in primary school.\n\n\tTo contribute, see\n\t\n    github.com/TypeTogether/Playwrite.\n\n\tGuidelines are present in all characters except for those used for letter/word spacing. To create a versatile tool for teachers when designing practice sheets that feature guidelines without corresponding letters, the underscore is used as a key character.

The Półtawski Nowy type family is intended for typesetting in sizes from 10 to 18 pt. The project is implemented thanks to the support of the Digital Culture 2020 program of the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage.\n\n    In the Półtawski Nowy digitisation, the source of the study were scans of a type specimen book from the Idźkowski i S-ka foundry, a set of drawings, punch patterns and punches made by Monotype in Salfords, Great Britain in 1934-1955. They were made available by the Type Archive London. Thanks to the standardization of characters and the balancing of the typographic rhythm, in the digital version, the typeface retains its ornamental character, while working well in smaller text sizes.

I’d been studying sans serif type as a project on the Typography & Graphic Communication course that I was taking at Reading University, and learning about the different strands of development: ‘grotesques’ such as the delightful Monotype Series 215 were designed by type cutters or draftsmen, while geometric and humanist sans serifs like Futura and Gill Sans were constructed with compasses or quills by rationalist typographers and calligraphers. In the end, of course, they all needed a little wash and brush-up from the typefounder – to say nothing of the type designs. I was also in thrall of a typeface called Ehrhardt, a Monotype revival typeface that is based on a seventeenth century design by Miklos Kis. It too had endured a lot of cleaning, but though they were hard on the source material, those responsible created a very elegant condensed typeface. The result looks a bit like a house on an Amsterdam canal.Puritan was my response to these influences; it was also a way (I thought) that I could get hold of an interesting typeface without unofficially borrowing from the Typography department.

This novel functionality is based on a theory known as\n    the “Shaver-Troup Formulation,” which was described in detail in a\n    2003 USA patent application.\n  \n    To learn more, read\n    The Design of Readex Pro\n    (English) and\n    خط ‏Readex Pro: استكشاف حدود سهولة قراءة النص من خلال خط عربي جديد (Arabic)",

    "description": "Roboto Flex upgrades Roboto so it becomes a more powerful typeface system. With Flex, you can customize Roboto to express and finesse your text in ways never before possible. Today, people are constantly switching between devices, resizing browsers, and\n    spreading our viewports across multiple screens. So Google commissioned Font Bureau to re-imagine Roboto to “flex” along with us, with a special emphasis on large-screen capabilities. This was achieved by amplifying the original design to an extreme\n    range of weights, grades, widths and optical sizes.\n\n    The second benefit of Roboto Flex is the designer’s ability to fitness and fine-tune their designs with parametric axes. Font Bureau first demonstrated the concept of parametric\n    axes in Amstelvar Alpha (2017), to provide the ultimate in typographic flexibility. With early prototypes of Roboto Flex, Font Bureau demonstrated new solutions to the typographic problems\n    that digital designers face. Demonstrations of high quality justification, better dark-mode typography and other uses of parametric axes are documented at variablefonts.typenetwork.com\n\n    The needs of developers, designers, and — of course — end-user readers were prioritized and aligned during development. To make Roboto Flex production-ready for all print and digital media, Font Bureau expanded the glyph set with careful planning and\n    development, in partnership with script experts for Cyrillic and Greek. Rigorous testing of each glyph across every axis required new type design tools to be developed, like typetools and videoproof,\n    which can be used to explore the depth of the design.\n\n    The final file size of the complete package is remarkably small, given the range of expressive styles now available. By driving variable fonts technology to its limits, it offers the most interesting and useful typographic tools for end users and designers.\n    With a fully loaded Optical Size axis, Roboto Flex makes the layout of texts with deep hierarchies more straightforward and heightens the quality of every design that uses it.\n\n    And none of this would be possible without the long list of contributors involved. Special thanks to David Berlow, Santiago Orozco, Ilya Ruderman, Irene Vlachou, Yury Ostromentsky, Mikhail Strukov, Dave Crossland, Damien Correll, Marc Foley, David Jonathan\n    Ross, Chris Lewis, Eben Sorkin, Viktoriya Grabowska, Adam Twardoch, Roel Nieksens, Laurence Penney, and Thomas Linard.\n\n    Roboto Flex is developed by Font Bureau for Google, based on the design initiated by Christian Robertson.

Created primarily for display use, the extreme difference between its letters’ thick and thin strokes make it an excellent choice for large headlines and poster-sized graphics. The Indian Type Foundry released Rozha One in 2014; its Devanagari character set was designed by Tim Donaldson and Jyotish Sonowal. Shiva Nallaperumal designed the Latin.The font’s Latin characters are drawn in a fat face ‘modern’ or ‘Didone’ style, similar to letters that were commonly used in 19th century advertising posters in the West. Rozha One’s Latin characters barely differentiate between upper and lowercase letter sizes; the x-height of its lowercase letters is so high – and the size of its capital letters so small – that these virtually blend into one another in a line of text. Nevertheless, the Devanagari letters are drawn in such a way that they harmonise with the font’s Latin very well in settings where texts in multiple languages sit alongside one another. The headline of the Devanagari base characters is the same thickness as the Latin letters’ serifs. Certain Devanagari letter strokes and vowel marks bare visually similarity to the font’s Latin letters. However, Rozha One does not appear Latinized or un-Devanagari.The font includes 1,095 glyphs, offering full support for the conjuncts and ligatures required by languages written with the Devanagari script. When used in on-screen design environments, Rozha One should be used in very large pixel sizes. However in print, the design may be used in a broader range of sizes, perhaps even as small as at 16 or 18 points.The Rozha project is led by Indian Type Foundry, a type design foundry based in Ahmedabad, India.

The Indian Type Foundry’s font families have been an exception, however. Sarpanch continues this trend. Sarpanch is an Open Source typeface supporting the Devanagari and Latin scripts. It was designed for use in large point sizes and pixel sizes. Sarpanch’s letterforms are made up of strokes with a high contrast. They are also drawn with wide proportions, based on a squared construction principle.Six fonts make up the Sarpanch family, ranging in weight from Regular to Black. As weight increases along the family’s axis, vertical strokes become thicker, but the typeface’s horizontals retain the same thickness across each weight. While the rather wide Regular weight of the family is almost monolinear, the Black weight appears to have a very high degree of contrast.The Regular, Medium and Semibold fonts are recommended for use in short headlines, while Bold, Heavy and Black are intended primarily for setting single words or pairs. At display sizes, Sarpanch works equally well on screen or in print. Each font contains 1035 glyphs and offers full support for the conjuncts and ligatures required by languages written in the Devanagari script.The Medium–Black weights of the Sarpanch family were design by Manushi Parikh at ITF in 2014.

    "description": "This font was developed by the Documenting Judeo-Spanish Project.\n\nDocumenting Judeo-Spanish is a digital humanities project that began in 2019 under the leadership of Dr. Bryan Kirschen. Recalling his initial fascination with Solitreo and the limited resources available to learn this script, Dr. Kirschen decided to focus this project on the cursive variety that was once common to speakers of Judeo-Spanish around the world. A nearly-extinct alphabet to an endangered language, this style of writing can be found in documents ranging from journal entries and ledgers to personal correspondence and community minutes. Many of these very documents are sitting in basements and attics today and, to the untrained eye, are mistaken for Hebrew.\n\nJudeo-Spanish (Ladino) refers to the variety of Spanish that developed among Jewish populations who were expelled from Spain in 1492 and subsequently settled throughout Turkey and the Balkans, then of the Ottoman Empire. These Jews, known as Sephardim, preserved many features of Medieval (varieties of) Spanish, while incorporating linguistic elements from the languages spoken in their surroundings, including: Turkish, Greek, Serbo-Croatian, French, Italian, and Arabic. As a Jewish language, the Spanish of the Sephardim has always been in contact with Hebrew. And while Judeo-Spanish may sound like other Romance languages, in writing, it would have traditionally appeared more similar to a Semitic language.\n\nSolitreo refers to the Hebrew-based cursive script once used by Sephardim; it is the cursive variety of the Rashi alphabet. Solitreo, or Soletreo, is derived from Galician/Portuguese, meaning ‘to spell.’ For many Sephardim, Solitreo was simply known as ganchos, meaning ‘hooks,’ due to the ligatures that form between letters. This style of writing is distinct from the Ashkenazi-based alphabet used for cursive Hebrew today, making documents in Solitreo undecipherable to the untrained eye. A similar style of writing can also be found in documents written in Judeo-Arabic. Today, Solitreo is a relic of the past, as most writers of the language utilize Roman characters.\n\nMost non-Hebrew glyphs in this font were forked from Kalam.\n\nTo contribute, see github.com/ladinoprojects/solitreo.",

This contradiction highlights its origin. \n\nA similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ and ฎ ฏ is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion when typesetting very short texts. \nTaviraj takes a specific approach when dealing with the thick and thin strokes of Thai glyphs. \nOther type designers of Thai fonts may like to use this approach as a reference. \nFormal looped Thai typefaces have delicate details so care must be taken when expanding them to heavier weights, to retain all the details.\nThe size and position of Thai vowel and tone marks has been managed carefully because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall texture.\n\nThe Taviraj project is led by Cadson Demak, a type foundry in Thailand. \nTo contribute, see github.com/cadsondemak/taviraj",

The Teko typeface features letterforms with low stroke contrast, square proportions and a structure that appears visually simple.The Regular, Medium and Semibold fonts are recommended for use in long headlines, while Bold is intended primarily for setting just one or two words. The Light is a beautiful variant that may be put to exceptionally good use in large headlines on websites. At display sizes, Teko works equally well on screen or in print. Each font contains 1090 glyphs, offering full support for the conjuncts and ligatures required by languages written with the Devanagari script. Teko is an excellent choice for use in advertising or for news tickers on television screens (breaking news, etc.)Manushi Parikh designed the Teko typeface for the Indian Type Foundry, who published it in 2014.In 2023, Marc Foley converted the family to a variable font.To contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/teko.",

An experimental feature is the distinction of good blackletter typography between required ligatures ‹ch, ck, ſt, tz› that must be kept when letterspacing is increased, and regular ligatures (for instance, ‹fi, fl›) that are broken up when letterspacing is increased.Using the ligatures: Whenever you type a sequence such as ‹tz›, it will automatically be displayed as a ligature. When you want to oppress a ligature, for instance in the German word «Zeitzone» ‘time zone’ that should have no tz-ligature, then you put a zero width non-joiner between the ‹t› and the ‹z› or, alternatively, you write «Zeit&zwnj;zone» in the HTML code.

The VT320 glyphs were designed with a nonrectangular pixel aspect ratio to fit the way the terminal scanned the CRT, so for this VT323 variation I had Python munge the locations and attempt to emulate the way the electron beam actually illuminated the phosphor and smeared the pixels horizontally on the terminal's CRT, so it looks more like what the actual glyph looked like on the screen. Python then drew the proper pixels into a 1:1 pixel grid as a monochrome PNG, which FontForge autoscanned into outlines.  I have attempted to support most of the glyphs available on the VT320, but that is a limited set to begin with, so please don't be disappointed that I haven't supported Esperanto or Riograndenser Hunsrückisch or whatever.There is another earlier variation called \"VT321\" that uses a more standard 1:1 pixel drawing technique, if you want to grab that as well.  I personally like VT323 better, and actually use it as my terminal font when cruising on the command line.",
